Hi, I'm aBUGSworstnightmare most places online. 
I'm located in Bavaria, Germany and interested in tinkering with Raspberry Pi. Most of my developments are related to driving TFT displays from the RPi.

Find some of my past projects on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfXBC0xASUtFc6JM_aYxhBg) 

If you like my work and want me to be able to keep improving it, please
